PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project simulates the scattering of a partially dynamic scatterer using the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). The individual dipoles taken as a whole emulate the optical scattering of many materials, from ground glass diffusers to the atmosphere to living tissue. 

REQUIREMENTS

This project requires MATLAB 2023a to run the codes.

USING THIS PROJECT

Using this project should be as simple as downloading the repository and running the file "dynamicScattererSimulations.m" in MATLAB. The code contains comments to help users follow the code. All of the functions called within this main code are also included in this repository in the "MATLAB Functions" folder.
